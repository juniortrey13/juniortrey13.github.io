      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm an emerging full-stack software engineer with 8+ years of experience in systems thinking, cross-functional collaboration, and delivering impact-driven programs. I recently completed Prime Digital Academy's immersive full-stack engineering program, where I built full-stack applications from the ground up using modern technologies. I bring not only technical skills but a strong foundation in problem-solving, project management, and team leadership developed through my previous work in education, policy, and nonprofit leadership.</p>
      <p>What drives me is building solutions that make people's lives easier, and collaborating with teams to deliver meaningful outcomes.</p>
